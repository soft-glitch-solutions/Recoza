# ♻️ Recoza

**Recoza** is an **open-source South African green-tech mobile application** that helps unemployed youth earn income by organising community recycling through trusted networks of friends, family, and neighbours.

The app turns informal recycling into dignified, structured work by helping collectors track recyclable items, plan weekly collections, and estimate earnings.

## 🌍 What Recoza Does

- Users can apply to become approved recycling collectors
- Collectors invite friends and family as their recycling clients
- Tracks recyclable items (bottles, cans, plastics)
