♻️ Recoza

Recoza is an open-source, South African green-tech mobile application that helps unemployed youth earn income by organising community recycling through trusted networks of friends, family, and neighbours.

The app turns informal recycling into dignified, structured work by helping collectors track items, plan weekly collections, and estimate earnings.
